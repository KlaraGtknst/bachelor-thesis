This thesis addresses the task of analysing large unstructured text corpora.
Their exploration is challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of the data, 
i.e.\ different formats and layouts, and the amount of information.
It is not possible to find a group of semantically similar documents by traversing corpora manually.
Therefore, this thesis explores different approaches to support the exploration of large unstructured text corpora 
by computational means with the goal of grouping documents according to their similarity.
