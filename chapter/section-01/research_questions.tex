\section{Research Questions}\label{sec:research-questions}
The following research questions build the guidelines for this thesis.

\subsection[\acs{rq}1]{\ac{rq}1: Effect of different preprocessing pipelines on performance?}\label{subsec:rq1}
In terms of \ac{rq}1, one could compare different types of stemmers (i.e. algorithmic vs. dictionary-based).

\subsection[\acs{rq}2]{\ac{rq}2: Effect of different similarity measurement types on performance?}\label{subsec:rq2}
In terms of \ac{rq}2, one could compare different types of similarity measurement types (i.e. cosine similarity vs. soft cosine similarity).

\subsection[\acs{rq}3]{\ac{rq}3: Which type of database is best suited for this task?}\label{subsec:rq3}
In terms of \ac{rq}3, one could compare different types of databases (i.e. object-orientated, relational, document).

\subsection[\acs{rq}4]{\ac{rq}4: Effect of different embeddings on performance?}\label{subsec:rq4}
In terms of \ac{rq}4, one could compare different types of embeddings (i.e. Doc2Vec, Bag-of-words, \ac{lda}, BERTopic).
