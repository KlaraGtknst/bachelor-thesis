% Besides literature research, application and evaluation of the methods identified, 
% a \ac{ui} is provided.
This work's goals include the implementation of a \ac{ui} for the techniques examined.
However, this \ac{ui} is not supposed to be an operational application for end users from the tax office 
but serves the purpose of displaying the techniques examined.
It should assist the natural human approach to exploration:
A human finds a document of interest, for instance, by keyword search, and thus, wants to find similar documents.
The tool should support keyword search, a detailed inspection of a document of interest and the exploration of similar documents.
