The dataset inspected in this thesis is the so-called \textit{Bahamas leak}.
It is a collection of roughly 38 \ac{gb} of fiscal documents, 
which were leaked in 2016 \cite{data-corpus-bahamas-leaks}.
The documents are unstructured, i.e.\ they are of different types, content and layout.
They are relevant in the context of tax fraud since they contain information about offshore companies and their owners.
Tax offices examine this dataset to identify tax evasion.
However, it has proven to be challenging to identify relevant documents and their interconnections due to the amount of documents contained in the leak.
