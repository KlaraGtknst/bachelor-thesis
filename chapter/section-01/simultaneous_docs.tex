Under the assumption that there are similar documents in the document corpus, 
this work infers it is valuable to explore semantically or visually similar documents simultaneously.
Hence, the analysis of the text corpus includes analysis in terms of textual information, i.e.\ content derived from the text, 
and visual information, i.e.\ appearance and layout.
The information gathered ought to be used to identify similarities between documents and group them.
