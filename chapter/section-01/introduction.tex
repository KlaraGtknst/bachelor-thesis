\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

The Bahamas leak is a collection of roughly 38 \ac{gb} documents, which were leaked in 2016 \cite{data-corpus-bahamas-leaks}.
Tax offices examine the data to identify tax evasion.
However, it has proven to be challenging to identify relevant documents and connections between documents due to the amount of documents in the leak.
Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to support the investigators of the tax offices.

The approach proposed in this thesis includes text mining and exploration methods including topic modelling.
Documents are grouped based on their semantic similarity or appearance.
In this work, a topic is denoted as a set of words which appears more often than average.
Hence, a topic is a statistical phenomenon.

Besides literature research, application and evaluation of the methods identified, 
certain preprocessing methods have proven to be eminent to successful work with unstructured text data.
These methods include tokenization, lemmatization and stop-word-lists.
