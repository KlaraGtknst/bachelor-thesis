\section{Own approach}\label{sec:own_approach}

This thesis proposes an approach to group documents based on their appearance or semantic similarity, 
which is defined via different embedding strategies, i.e.\ methods to derive embeddings from texts.
Embeddings are numerical representations of words, sentences or texts.
They enable the comparison of heterogeneous data via cosine similarity, i.e.\ the angle between embedding vectors, 
whereas visual information is clustered using different approaches including \acs*{optics} (cf. \autoref{subsec:optics}) beforehand.
The resulting groups of documents are visualized using \wordcloud{}s.
%The goal of topic analysis techniques is to identify topics in a document corpus.
