\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

% Motivation: why is this thesis relevant?
On a broader scope, this thesis aims to provide computational means to facilitate the work with large unstructured text data for individuals.
The goal is to actively use \ac{ml} techniques to analyse a large text corpus and thus, reduce the amount of manual human work.
This thesis assumes that there are similar documents and that it is valuable to explore semantically or visually similar documents simultaneously.
Hence, the analysis of the text corpus includes analysis in terms of textual information, i.e. content, and visual information, i.e. appearance and layout, mimicking a human approach.
The information gathered ought to be used to identify similarities between documents and group them.
Topics of a document cluster do not have to be labelled specifically but should be interpretable.
