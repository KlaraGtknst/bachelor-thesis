\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

% Motivation: why is this thesis relevant?
On a broader scope, this thesis aims to provide computational means to facilitate the work with large unstructured text data for individuals.
The goal is to actively use \ac{ml} techniques to analyse a large text corpus and thus, reduce the amount of manual human work.

In the context of tax fraud, large unstructured text data, such as the Bahamas leak is examined by tax offices.
However, tax offices do not have sufficient resources to look through all documents to find an object of interest, for instance, an invoice.
Hence, \ac{ml} techniques ought to facilitate the work of investigators by reducing manual labour.
These methods should propose visually or semantically similar documents, for instance, invoices, to the investigator.
