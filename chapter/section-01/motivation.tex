\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

% Motivation: why is this thesis relevant?
On a broader scope, this thesis aims to provide computational means to facilitate the work with large unstructured text data for individuals.
The goal is to actively use \ac{ml} techniques to analyze a large text corpus and thus, reduce the amount of manual human work, 
increase efficiency and minimize costs and mistakes.

In the context of tax fraud, large unstructured text data, such as the Bahamas leak is examined by tax offices.
However, tax offices do not have sufficient resources to examine all documents to find an object of interest, for instance, an invoice.
Hence, \ac{ml} techniques ought to facilitate the work of investigators by reducing manual labor.
These methods should propose visually, i.e.\ of the same document type, or semantically, i.e.\ from the same company, similar documents to the investigator.
