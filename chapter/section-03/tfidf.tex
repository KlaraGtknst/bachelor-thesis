\ac{tfidf} provides a numerical representation of a word in a document \cite{clusteringDocs2020}.
It considers the frequency $f_{w_{ij}, d_i}$  of a word $w_{ij}$ in a document $d_i$ and the frequency of a word in the whole corpus. 
The frequency $f_{w_{ij}, d_i}$ is defined as $f_{w_{ij}, d_i} = \frac{\# \text{occurrences of } w_{ij} \text{ in }d_i}{\# \text{words in }d_i}$.

\ac{tfidf} is calculated as displayed in \autoref{eq:tfidf-formula} from \cite{clusteringDocs2020}.
The \ac{tf} is determined utilizing $TF(w_{ij}, d_i) = f_{w_{ij}, d_i}$, whereas the \ac{idf} is computed by $IDF(w_{ij}, D) = \log_2\frac{M}{M_{ij}}$, 
$M_{ij}$ being the number of documents the term $w_{ij}$ appears in.
\ac{idf} measures the importance of a term $w_{ij}$ in the corpus of documents $D$
under the assumption that a term's importance to the data corpus is inversely proportional to its occurrence frequency \cite{tfidf2008}.
In other words: Terms which appear in many documents are not as important and thus, weighted less than document-specific terms. 
The calculation of \ac{tf} and \ac{idf} is visualized exemplary in \autoref{fig:tfidf-calculation}.

\begin{equation}
    TFIDF(w_{ij}, d_i, D) = TF(w_{ij}, d_i) \cdot IDF(w_{ij}, D)
    \label{eq:tfidf-formula}
\end{equation}

        Exemplary calculation of \ac{tf} and \ac{idf} for a document corpus $D$: 
        \ac{tf} only considers the documents of interest while 
        \ac{idf} incorporates the importance of the word with respect to $D$.

%According to \citeauthor{tfidf2008}, the computation complexity of \ac{tfidf} embeddings is $O(V \cdot M)$.
\ac{tfidf} has several drawbacks \cite{clusteringDocs2020,tfidf2008}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \ac{tfidf} does not consider semantic similarities between words.
    \item \ac{tfidf} does not take into account the order of words in a document.
    \item \ac{tfidf} often produces high dimensional representations which have to be postprocessed to reduce their dimensionality, e.g., by using \ac{pca}.
    \item The embeddings are not derived from a mathematical model of term distribution and thus, are occasionally criticised as not well reasoned.
\end{itemize}
