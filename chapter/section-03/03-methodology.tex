\chapter{Fundamentals}\label{ch:methodology} %/ State of the art

The following chapter outlines the theoretical principles of the methods used in this work.
First, the preprocessing of the data is described in \autoref{sec:preprocessing}.
Then, a variety of ways to generate numerical representations of textual data is outlined in \autoref{sec:embeddings}.
Afterwards, the different similarity measurements are introduced in \autoref{sec:similarity-measurement}.
A selection of conventional topic analysis approaches is outlined in \autoref{sec:topic-modeling}.
Subsequently, two data compression techniques are presented in \autoref{sec:compression}.
Then, \autoref{sec:clustering} presents multiple clustering methods.
Finally, the libraries used to implement the web application and the database are introduced in \autoref{sec:frameworks}.

\section{Software frameworks}\label{sec:frameworks}

The different methods explored in this work ought to be presented in a web application.
This application should be used to compare the methods and to visualize the results.
The database applied to store the results is described in \autoref{sec:db}.
The web interface is implemented using \flask{} and \angular{}.
\autoref{sec:BE_flask} and \autoref{sec:FE_angular} describe the frameworks and their components.
