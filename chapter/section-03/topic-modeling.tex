\section{Topic Modelling}\label{sec:topic-modeling}

Since more and more textual data emerges, methods to analyze and extract information from texts become more important.
One of these methods is topic modeling.
%It is used to discover groups of words with similar meanings in a text corpus \cite{topic_modeling2015}.
A topic can be defined as a cluster of words that occur frequently.
Subsequently, it is described by a probability distribution over a vocabulary.
A document can be represented by one or more topics. %and thus, can be created by a distribution over topics and a distribution over words given the topics.
%According to \citeauthor{topic_modeling2015}, topic models ignore the order of words in a document by relying on the bag-of-words assumption.
Common topic modeling algorithms include \ac{lda} \cite{topic_modeling2015}.

\subsection{\wordcloud{}s}\label{subsec:word-clouds}

A \wordcloud{} is a technique to visualize the most predominant words in a text \cite{topic_modeling2019}.
The size of a word correlates to its frequency or importance in the text.
However, a word does not have to be meaningful to appear large.
A \wordcloud{} does not provide information about the meaning or context of words and thus, 
one has to be careful when interpreting the results.
