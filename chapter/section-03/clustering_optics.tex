Similar to the approach from \cite{OPTICS1999}, \ac{optics} was used to cluster the images of the first page of documents in this work.
The procedure is displayed in \autoref{fig:OPTICS_procedure}.
There were two different preprocessing approaches:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \label{pt:32}The images were first preprocessed to 32x32 greyscale pixels and afterwards compressed to 13-dimensional vectors using \ac{pca} as visualized in \autoref{fig:preprocessed_docs_32x32}.
    \item \label{pt:eigendocs}The technique \eigendocs{} from \autoref{subsec:eigenface} 
    was used to compress the images to 13-dimensional greyscale images as displayed in \autoref{fig:preprocessed_docs_eigendocs}.
\end{enumerate}

The reachability distance ordered by \ac{optics} is displayed in \autoref{fig:reachability_plots}.
The resulting clusters are displayed in \autoref{fig:optics_cluster}.
