\subsection{\angular{}}\label{sec:FE_angular}

\angular{} is a framework for building web applications.
It uses Node.js and TypeScript.
Usually, the source code is structured into different modules, including components and services.
Components are used to define the appearance of the application, while
service modules contain the logic of the application and communicate with the backend.

% creating applications
\angular{} applications are created using the \texttt{ng new NAME} command line interface \cite{angular_book2018}.
This command creates a skeleton, which can be customized to meet the needs of the application.
By running \texttt{ng serve} the application can be served locally.
