\ac{lda} is a generative model, which recreates the original document word distributions with minimal error given topics \cite{topic_modeling2015, Top2Vec2020}.
A discrete multinomial probability distribution over a vocabulary consisting of $W$ words is called a topic.
A document is a mixture of $K$ topics.
Hence, each document from the document corpus $D$ is represented by specific topic probabilities.

Due to the fact that high probability words are considered to be informative, \ac{lda} may regard words, 
which occur frequently as important even though they might be uninformative in reality \cite{Top2Vec2020}.
