% BERTopic
Some researchers have already developed complete topic analysis libraries.
They merge a selection of the techniques stated above into a well-reasoned composite.
Best-known examples include BERTopic, a composition of \ac{sbert}, a dimension reduction using \ac{umap}, \ac{hdbscan} clustering and the application of \ac{tfidf} on the clusters \cite{bertopic2022}.
% The BERTopic approach outlined by \citeauthor{bertopic2022} consists of multiple components which are similar to the idea proposed in this thesis:
% Namely, using similarity measures on (different precomputed) embeddings and displaying the resulting clusters human interpretable.
% More concretely, the clustering algorithm used to group the documents based on visual similarity is related to \ac{hdbscan}.

% LDA
Other well-established topic analysis approaches consist of \ac{lda}.
\citeauthor{lda2008} propose a technique that first applies \ac{lda} to reduce the data's dimensionality and thereafter classifies the result with a \ac{svm} \cite{lda2008}.
Similarly, \citeauthor{LDA2016} use a \ac{knn} algorithm instead of a \ac{svm} on the textual subspace generated by \ac{lda} \cite{LDA2016}.
Another technique proposed is LDA2VEC, which is subject to \citeauthor{evolution_of_topic_modeling2022}'s work \cite{evolution_of_topic_modeling2022}.
\citeauthor{topic_modeling2021}'s paper introduces an open-source library for topic model visualization, exemplary showcased on a Wikipedia dataset \cite{topic_modeling2021}.

% Top2Vec
\citeauthor{Top2Vec2020} and \citeauthor{Topic2Vec2015} claim that the \ac{t2v} model not only overcomes \ac{lda}'s shortcomings \cite{Top2Vec2020, Topic2Vec2015}
but is also developed for topic analysis on a large collection of documents \cite{Top2Vec2020}.
The \ac{t2v} library serves as a baseline model for the application developed in this work.
