% BERTopic
Due to the prevailing need for means to group data without manual inspection, there have been multiple approaches to topic modelling.
Best-known examples include BERTopic, a composition of \ac{sbert}, a dimension reduction using \ac{umap}, \ac{hdbscan} clustering and the application of \ac{tfidf} on the clusters \cite{bertopic2022}.
The BERTopic approach outlined by \citeauthor{bertopic2022} consists of multiple components which are similar to the idea proposed in this thesis:
Namely, using similarity measures on (different precomputed) embeddings and displaying the resulting clusters human interpretable.
More concretely, the clustering algorithm used to group the documents based on visual similarity is related to \ac{hdbscan}.

% LDA
Some well-established topic modelling approaches consist of \ac{lda}.
\citeauthor{lda2008} propose first using \ac{lda} to reduce the data's dimensionality and afterwards classifying the lower dimensional text data with a \ac{svm} \cite{lda2008}.
Similarly, \citeauthor{LDA2016} apply not a \ac{svm}, but the \ac{knn} algorithm on the textual subspace generated by \ac{lda} \cite{LDA2016}.
Another technique proposed is LDA2VEC, which is subject to \citeauthor{evolution_of_topic_modeling2022}'s work \cite{evolution_of_topic_modeling2022}.
\citeauthor{topic_modeling2021} have published an open-source visualization of topic models, which provides a browsing interface.
They include exemplary images of their interface on a Wikipedia dataset in their paper \cite{topic_modeling2021}.

% Top2Vec
\citeauthor{Top2Vec2020} and \citeauthor{Topic2Vec2015} claim that the \topTwovec{} model not only overcomes \ac{lda} shortcomings \cite{Top2Vec2020, Topic2Vec2015}
but is also developed for topic modelling on a large collection of documents \cite{Top2Vec2020}.
This approach is compared to the methods applied in this work.

% time and dynamic
Even though this thesis assumes the topics prevalent are static, in reality, topics may be dynamic or change over time.
\citeauthor{topic_modeling2015} and \citeauthor{topic_modeling2020} have published a survey on common topic modelling techniques, 
including \ac{lda} and more advanced models which take into account factors such as time \cite{topic_modeling2015, topic_modeling2020}.
