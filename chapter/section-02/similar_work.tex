Due to the prevailing need for means to group data without manual inspection, there have been multiple approaches to topic modelling.
Best-known examples include BERTopic, a composition of \ac{sbert}, a dimension reduction using \ac{umap}, \ac{hdbscan} clustering and the application of \ac{tfidf} on the clusters \cite{bertopic2022}.
The BERTopic approach outlined by \citeauthor{bertopic2022} consists of multiple components which are similar to the idea proposed in this thesis:
Namely, using similarity measures on (different precomputed) embeddings and displaying the resulting clusters human interpretable.
More concretely, the clustering algorithm used to group the documents based on visual similarity is related to \ac{hdbscan}.

Another technique proposed is LDA2VEC, which is subject to \citeauthor{evolution_of_topic_modeling2022}'s work \cite{evolution_of_topic_modeling2022}.
