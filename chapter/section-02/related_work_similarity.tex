% similarity
To determine the similarity between two objects, one has to define a metric.
Prevalent metrics in the domain of comparing objects in a \ac{vsm} include (soft) cosine similarity 
outlined by \citeauthor{soft_cosine2014}, as well as by \citeauthor{soft_cosine2017} \cite{soft_cosine2014, soft_cosine2017},
the Manhattan and the Euclidean norm \cite{euclidean_l2_norm2015}.
\citeauthor{soft_cosine2014} propose the calculation of the soft similarity.
\citeauthor{soft_cosine2017} state that the soft cosine similarity is superior to the cosine similarity since it takes into account the relations between words.
When comparing different norms in the context of \ac{ir} from images \citeauthor{euclidean_l2_norm2015} find that the Manhattan norm has a better 
precision than the Euclidean norm.
The similarity metric used in this work is the cosine similarity.
