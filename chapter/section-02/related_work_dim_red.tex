% dimensionality reduction
\citeauthor{dim_reduction2021} propose a survey on different dimensionality reduction techniques including \acs*{pca}, \acs*{lda} and \acs*{svd} \cite{dim_reduction2021}.
They conceptually categorize and compare the techniques.
The authors conduct experiments on different datasets to compare the techniques' performance on classification tasks.
They find that the classification accuracy 
obtained on the reduced version of the datasets is superior to 
the accuracy achieved on the original datasets.
Their work serves as a theoretical foundation for \autoref{sec:compression}.

% AE 
Another dimensionality reduction technique is an \acs*{ae} \cite{autoencoder2020, autoencoder2021}.
The papers provide a theoretical foundation for \autoref{subsec:autoencoder}.
An \acs*{ae} learns a meaningful low-dimensional representation of the input.
This representation is used as a compressed version of certain embeddings in this work.
