% dimensionality reduction
\citeauthor{dim_reduction2021} propose a survey on different dimensionality reduction techniques including \acs*{pca}, \acs*{lda} and \acs*{svd} \cite{dim_reduction2021}.
They conceptually categorize and compare the techniques.
The authors conduct experiments on different datasets to compare the techniques' performance on classification tasks.
They find that the classification accuracy obtained on reduced datasets is superior to the original dataset.
Their work serves as a theoretical foundation for \autoref{sec:compression}.

% AE 
Another dimensionality reduction technique is the \acs*{ae} \cite{autoencoder202, autoencoder2021}.
The papers provide a theoretical foundation for \autoref{subsec:autoencoder}.
An \acs*{ae} learns a meaningful low-dimensional representation of the input.
This representation is used as a compressed version of certain embeddings in this work.
