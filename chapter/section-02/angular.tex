\angular{} is a framework for building web applications.
It uses Node.js and TypeScript.

% creating applications
\angular{} applications are created using the \texttt{ng new NAME} command line interface \cite{angular_book2018}.
This command creates a skeleton, which can be customized to the needs of the application.
By running \texttt{ng serve} the application can be served locally.
