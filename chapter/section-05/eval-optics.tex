% 3d plots
The algorithm \ac{optics} is applied to data, which is preprocessed according to \autoref{pt:32} (cf. \cite{OPTICS1999}) 
and \autoref{pt:eigendocs} (i.e.\ \eigendocs{}) from \autoref{subsec:impl-optics}.
The clusters from \autoref{fig:optics_cluster} are extracted from the respective reachability plots in \autoref{fig:reachability_plots}.
The three-dimensional plots visualize the first three dimensions of the data and thus, 
the weights of the first three principal components assigned by the \eigendocs{} algorithm.
By visual inspection and comparison of both plots, 
it can be seen that the projection by the \eigendocs{} approach of \autoref{pt:eigendocs} scatters the objects further in the three-dimensional space.
One could argue that this is due to the fact, 
that the input data encodes not only the visual appearance in terms of page layout but also the size of the document.
Possibly, the objects are grouped by document size.


% cluster content
To analyze the results of the clustering, the content of the clusters is examined.
Since the documents are not labeled, the content of the clusters is analyzed by visual inspection and displayed in \autoref{fig:optics_content_cluster}.
The yellow images belong to the group identified as noise.
The images preprocessed according to \autoref{pt:32} are partitioned into more clusters than the \eigendocs{} approach.
Most of the certificates are classified as noise for both approaches in the trials carried out.

The approach from \autoref{pt:32} (cf. \cite{OPTICS1999}) omits information about the images' original size. 
This information is encoded in the \eigendocs{} approach.
Hence, the preprocessing approach chosen to create the \ac{optics} input for the \databaseName{} database index is \eigendocs{}. 

% code
According to \citeauthor{OPTICS2014}, \ac{optics} was developed to improve \ac{dbscan} flaws.
With respect to the evolution of these clustering methods, i.e.\ \ac{dbscan} being \ac{optics} basis, 
\ac{dbscan} is chosen for the clustering method in \lst{lst:optics_model}.
In order to reduce calculation complexity the maximum $\varepsilon$ is 10.
The distance between two points to still be considered neighbours is defined after a visual inspection of the reachability plot.
Considering the intrinsic structure of the \eigendocs{} data, it is set to $1.5$ to return meaningful clusters.
