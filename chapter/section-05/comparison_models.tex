\section{Comparison of models}\label{sec:evaluation-models}

% parameters
Similar to \citeauthor{glove2014}'s work, in this work, for many models used, any unspecified parameters are set to their default values, 
assuming that they are close to optimal
acknowledging that this simplification should be revised in a more thorough analysis.

% comparing models (qualitative)
The different query responses of the models are compared on a selection of documents.
The selection is obtained by randomly choosing \textcolor{red}{TODO: X} documents from a corpus of 2095 documents.
The 2095 document corpus was randomly chosen from the Bahamas leak.
The \textcolor{red}{TODO: Y} most similar documents for each selected document are retrieved from the database for each model and stored in a \ac{csv} file.
To facilitate working with the data, the document IDs are encoded as monotonically increasing integers.

Furthermore, the query results are compared using a Venn diagram and a heatmap presented in \autoref{fig:comparison-models}.
% Venn diagram
To build a Venn diagram, the number of documents which are shared between the query results of two models is computed.
Hence, all query results of a model are saved in a set and the intersection of two sets is computed.
Since there are five models the Venn diagram consists of five circles.

% heatmap
Before the heatmap can be created, the shared query results of each model pair are computed and stored in a matrix.
The matrix consists of five rows and five columns, where each row and column represents a model.
The code snippet in \lst{lst:sim-matrix} shows the calculation of the similarity matrix.
The cell values are the number of shared query results between the models of the row and column.
They are calculated by summing up the number of shared query results per document query.
Since the matrix is symmetric, only the upper triangular matrix is computed and the other half is mirrored.
The matrix is then visualized using a heatmap.
