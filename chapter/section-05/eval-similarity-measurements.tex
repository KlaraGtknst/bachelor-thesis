\subsection*{Similarity measurements}\label{subsec:evaluation-sim-measurements}

According to \citeauthor{HfsentTrans2019}, the similarity measurements discussed in \autoref{sec:similarity-measurement} 
obtained roughly the same results in their experiments \cite{HfsentTrans2019}.   

% similarity
As the similarity between vectors is usually calculated using some form of cosine similarity, 
rather than Euclidean distance in literature, cosine similarity is preferable over Euclidean distance. 
Since the models may produce embeddings which are not normalized, the cosine similarity is used instead of the dot product.
