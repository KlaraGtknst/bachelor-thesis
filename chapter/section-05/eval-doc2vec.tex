\subsection*{\ac{d2v}}\label{subsec:evaluation-doc2vec}

Since no labeled data is available, the evaluation of the \ac{d2v} embeddings is limited.
Therefore, the \ac{d2v} embeddings are evaluated by comparing them to other embeddings.
The \ac{d2v} model is not tuned in terms of hyperparameter selection,
but the default settings are used since there is no way to evaluate the resulting embeddings.
