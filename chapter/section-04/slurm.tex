Since the data corpus is too big to be processed locally on a \localMaschineStats{}, the Chair \ac{ies} has offered to provide computational means to solve this problem.
The scripts can be processed by multiple nodes which are managed by \slurm{}. 
\slurm{} is an open-source management tool for Linux clusters \cite{slurm-online}.
It allocates resources, i.e.\ compute nodes, and provides the means to start, execute and monitor jobs \cite{slurm-online, slurm2003}.

The so-called \slurm{} daemons control nodes, partitions, jobs and job steps \cite{slurm-online}.
A partition is a group of nodes and a job is the allocation of resources, i.e.\ compute nodes, to a user for a limited period of time.
A basic visualization of the architecture is given in \autoref{fig:slurm-architecture}.

    The nodes communicate.
    The user can use certain commands, for instance \texttt{srun} and \texttt{squeue}, anywhere on the cluster.

% sbatch scripts
A job is started by a \texttt{sbatch} script.
This script defines the \texttt{partition}, the \texttt{job-name}, the number of \texttt{nodes}, the \texttt{cpus-per-task}, the memory \texttt{mem} allocated, 
the \texttt{time} limit and the path to store \texttt{error} and \texttt{output} logs.
It is possible to work on multiple CPUs simultaneously to divide the workload of a task.
In this work, multiple \texttt{sbatch} scripts are used to carry out a variety of tasks.
A summary of the tasks and scripts is given in \autoref{tbl:sbatch-scripts}.
