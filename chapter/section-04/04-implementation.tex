\chapter{Implementation}\label{ch:implementation}

This chapter describes how the theoretical basics from \autoref{ch:methodology} interplay and how they are used in this thesis.
Specific parameter choices are explained in \autoref{ch:evaluation}.

\section{Trade-off between memory and query time}\label{sec:trade-off}

At the beginning of this thesis, it was unclear to what degree the tool, 
i.e. the database fields and query results should be precomputed.
The decision to build a tool which was trained once offline seemed to be the only option facing the amount of data.
Since \databaseName{} provides fast queries, it is sufficient to rely on real-time queries.

In the course of filling the database with information, 
one had to face obstacles not only regarding excessive memory usage but also time-consuming run time of methods.
Early on it became clear that one either had to reduce accuracy and details in order to achieve less memory or 
one had to settle for minutes to hours of calculations and bigger costs in terms of memory consumption.

Beforehand, it was not as clear which information, i.e. fields in the database, seemed worth the time and memory.
For instance, initially, the image of the first \ac{pdf} page of each document was saved alongside the other fields within the database.
After scaling the amount of data stored in the database to about 2900 documents, 
this approach caused severe issues in terms of memory usage.
Hence, this field was omitted.
