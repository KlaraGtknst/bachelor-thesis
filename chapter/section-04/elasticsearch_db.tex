\section{Evaluation of database}\label{subsec:evaluation-db}

According to \cite{flask_book2018}, \ac{sql} databases are a good choice for storing structured data in an efficient way.
This is because their paradigm \acs{ACID}, i.e. \acl{acid}, provides high reliability.
No\ac{sql} databases, on the other hand, are more flexible and can be used to store unstructured data \cite{flask_book2018}.
