% architecture
In order to determine, which dimensionality of the latent space is the best option, 
different architectures were tested and compared in terms of \ac{rsme} and cosine similarity.

    \caption{The effect of different \ac{ae} architectures on the reconstruction error.
    The error is measured in terms of \ac{rsme} (blue bars) and cosine similarity (yellow bars) between the original and the reconstructed image.
    The smallest \ac{rsme} and the biggest cosine similarity belong to the architecture best suitable to this task and are coloured green.
