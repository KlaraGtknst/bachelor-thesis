\subsubsection*{\ac{use}}\label{subsubsec:impl-use}

The \ac{use} model implemented with TensorFlow \cite{HfsentTrans2019}.
In this work, the fourth version of the model is used.
The implementation from Tfhub uses the \ac{dan} architecture \cite{UniversalSentEnc-dev}.
The \ac{use} file has a size of about 1 \ac{gb}. % and thus, loading the model takes a while.
It is not necessary to preprocess the data for the model.
