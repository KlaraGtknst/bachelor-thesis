\subsection{Clustering}\label{subsec:clustering}

Clustering is used in a variety of domains to group data into meaningful subsclasses, i.e. clusters \cite{OPTICS2013, OPTICS2014, OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
According to \citeauthor{OPTICS2013}, common domains include anomaly/ outlier detection, noise filtering, document clustering and image segmentation. 
The goal is to find clusters, which have a low inter-class similarity and a high intra-class similarity \cite{OPTICS2013}.
The similarity is measured by a distance function, which is dependent on the data type. 
Common distance functions are the Euclidean distance, the Manhattan distance and the Minkowski distance \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.

There are multiple clustering techniques, which can be divided into four categories \cite{OPTICS2016}: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical clustering}:
    Algorithms, which create spherical or conex shaped clusters, possibly naturally occurring. 
    A terminal condition has to be defined beforehand.
    Examples include CLINK and SLINK \cite{OPTICS2014}.

    \item \textbf{Partitional based clustering}: 
    Algorithms, which partition the data into $k$ clusters, whereas $k$ is given apriori.
    Clusters are shaped in a spherical manner, are similar in size and not necessarily naturally occurring.
    KMeans is a popular example of a partitional based clustering algorithm.

    \item \textbf{Density based clustering}:
    Resulting clusters can be of arbitrary shape and size.
    The number of clusters does not have to be defined apriori.
    However, the algorithms are sensitive to input parameters, such as radius, minimum number of points and threshold.
    Popular examples are DBSCAN and OPTICS.
    
    \item \textbf{Grid based clustering}:
    Similar to density based clustering, but according to \citeauthor{OPTICS2016} better than density based clustering.
    Examples include flexible grid-based clustering \cite{OPTICS2014}.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{KMeans}\label{subsec:kmeans}

The goal of KMeans is to partition the data/ $n \in \mathbb{N}$  objects into $k \in \mathbb{N}$  clusters, whereas $k$ is given apriori \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}. %
First, $k$ centroids, i.e. cluster center, are randomly initialized.
Then, the objects are assigned to the closest centroid.
Afterwards, the centroids are updated by calculating the mean of the assigned objects.
The process is repeated until the terminating condition, for instance no more change in the clusters, is met \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
By iteratively reassinging the objects to the closest centroid and updating the centroids, 
the algorithm minimizes the within-cluster sum of squared errors $E$, i.e. the sum of squared distances between objects in a cluster and their centroid, 
calculated in \autoref{eq:kmeans-error} from \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}, 
where $C_{i}$ is the $i$-th cluster and $\mu_{i}$ is the mean of the objects in $C_{i}$.

\begin{equation}
    E = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_{i}}\left\|x-\mu_{i}\right\|^{2}
\label{eq:kmeans-error}
\end{equation}

\citeauthor{OPTICS_kMeans_2016} claim, hat KMeans will not identfy outliers.


\subsubsection{DBSCAN}\label{subsec:dbscan}

The clusters identfied by DBSCAN have a high density, i.e. minimum number of objects within a certain distance of each other, and are seperated by low density regions \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
In order to create clusters of minimum size and density, DBSCAN distinguishes between three types of objects \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Core objects}: 
    An object with at least $minPts$ objects in its $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood $N_\varepsilon$ (within radius $varepsilon$).

    \item \textbf{Border objects}: 
    An object with less than $minPts$ objects in its $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood, but is in the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of a core object.

    \item \textbf{Noise objects}: 
    An object, which is neither a core object nor a border object.
\end{enumerate}

\citeauthor{OPTICS_kMeans_2016} define $x$ is directly density reachable from $y$ as object $x$ is in the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of core object $y$ \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
Moreover, a point is density reachable from another, if there is a chain of objects, which are directly density reachable from each other \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
$x$ and $y$ are said to be density connected, if there is a object $z$, from which both $x$ and $y$ are density reachable \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.

The DBSCAN algorithm starts by labeling all objects as core, border or noise points.
Then, it elimated noise points and links all core points, which are within each others neighbourhood \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
Groups of connected core points form a cluster \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
At the end every border point is assigned to the cluster of its corresponding core points \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
This algorithm creates clusters as maximal set of density connected points \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.

According to \citeauthor{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}, DBSCAN can identify outlier or noise.
However, the algorithm is sensitive to the input parameters $minPts$ and $\varepsilon$ and has difficulties distinguishing closely located cluster \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.



\subsubsection{HDBSCAN*}\label{subsec:hdbcan}


\subsubsection{OPTICS}\label{subsec:optics}

Opposed to DBSCAN, OPTICS is able to detect clusters of varying densities \cite{OPTICS2014}.
OPTICS produces an order of the elements according distance to the already added elements \cite{OPTICS2014}:
The first element added to the order list is arbitrary.
$\varepsilon$ defines the neighbourhood radius, i.e. the maximum distance between two elements, which are still considered to be in the same neighbourhood \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
The order list is iteratively expanded by adding the element of the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of the order list items, which is has the smallest distance to any of the elements already in the order list.
Hence, clusters with higher density, i.e. lower $\varepsilon$, are added first (prioritized) \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
When there are no more elements in the $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood to add, the process is repeated for the other clusters.

Hence, this procedure enables the extraction of clusters for arbitrary $0 \le \varepsilon_i \le \varepsilon$ \cite{OPTICS_kMeans_2016}.
However, the algorithm is sensitive to the input parameters $minPts$ and $\varepsilon$.
