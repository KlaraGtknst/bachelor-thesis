% Future: continue developing this application with tax office
The evaluation of the similarity between query results of different models so far has not considered the individual weights for respective query responses.
Thus, future work could include the weights of the query responses in the evaluation.
However, in this work, the weights were not considered since it was difficult to find means to visualize semantic meaningful weight relationships.

% Future work

% AE config

% elastic stack: Kibana
The elastic stack offers a wide range of tools, for instance, Kibana that can be used to manage models and 
to create ingest pipelines to embed new documents.
If models are managed by Kibana, the models no longer have to be managed by the user and thus, 
the system would most likely be more user-friendly and less prone to errors.

% server database
Another issue is the fact that the database does neither contain all embeddings nor all documents.
The Bahamas leak contains 38 \ac{gb} of data.
