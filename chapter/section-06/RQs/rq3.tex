% RQ3: presentation to experts
\paragraph{\ref{enum:rq3}} poses the question of how the results of the system are presented to experts.
% 3.1. Web interface
The idea of the representation is to enable users to explore the data corpus.
They should be able to query for terms,
to find similar documents in the text corpus and 
to derive the inherent topics of the documents.
The proof of concept is the implementation of a web interface which offers these services.
The web interface is introduced in \autoref{sec:ui}.
