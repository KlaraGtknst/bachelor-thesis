% extra findings
Besides the research questions, some additional findings are presented in the following.

% 5.1 TFIDF & Infersent vector size
The \infersent{} and the \ac{tfidf} model produce embeddings of large dimensionalities.
Since changing the dimensionality would require retraining the models 
or risking loss of quality, the dimensionality is not changed in this work.

% 5.2. DB: Elasticsearch
The database \databaseName{} was chosen because it offers built-in functionalities,
such as \ac{knn} and fuzzy text search.
It is well-suited for flexible data since it is possible to insert 
incomplete documents into the database.
However, the maximum dimensionality of the embeddings is limited to 2048.
If the task at hand requires higher dimensional embeddings, such as the \infersent{} model, 
another database may be more suitable.
