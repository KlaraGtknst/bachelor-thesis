Finding relevant documents and connections between multiple ones becomes significantly more difficult due to the sheer amount of documents available.
Institutes, such as the (German) tax offices have access to leak data, e.g., the Bahama leak, containing huge amounts of documents and valuable information yet to be extracted.
However, these institutes, companies and individuals do not have sufficient resources to explore individual documents in order to find a specific one or to identify the key topics of them.
Hence, computational means, such as text mining, may facilitate the situation.
This thesis proposes an approach to find relevant documents and identify topics from a large text corpus.
