Finding relevant documents and interconnections becomes significantly more difficult due to the sheer amount of documents available.
Institutes, such as German tax offices, have access to leak data, for instance, the Bahama leak, containing huge amounts of documents and valuable information yet to be extracted.
However, these institutes, companies and individuals do not have sufficient resources to explore individual documents in order to find a specific one or to identify inherent key topics.
Hence, computational means, such as text mining or topic modeling, may help to overcome this obstacle.
This thesis proposes an approach to finding relevant documents which share common topics from a large text corpus.
